# arxiv.org   
  arXiv (pronounced "archive"—the X represents the Greek letter chi [χ]) is a repository of electronic preprints (known as e-prints) approved for posting after moderation, but not full peer review. 
It consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, electrical engineering, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, mathematical finance and economics, which can be accessed online. 
In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv repository. 
Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million-article milestone on October 3, 2008, and had hit a million by the end of 2014. By October 2016 the submission rate had grown to more than 10,000 per month.

# arxiv-sanity.com  
  This project is a web interface that attempts to tame the overwhelming flood of papers on Arxiv. 
It allows researchers to keep track of recent papers, search for papers, sort papers by similarity to any paper, 
see recent popular papers, to add papers to a personal library, and to get personalized recommendations of (new or old) Arxiv papers. 
This code is currently running live at www.arxiv-sanity.com/, where it's serving 25,000+ Arxiv papers from Machine Learning (cs.[CV|AI|CL|LG|NE]/stat.ML) over the last ~3 years.
