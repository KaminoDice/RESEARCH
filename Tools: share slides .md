# LinkedIn SlideShare 
is a hosting service for professional content including presentations, infographics, documents, and videos. 
Users can upload files privately or publicly in PowerPoint, Word, PDF, or OpenDocument format. 
Content can then be viewed on the site itself, on hand held devices or embedded on other sites.
Launched on October 4, 2006, the website is considered to be similar to YouTube, but for slideshows. 
It was acquired by LinkedIn in 2012. The website was originally meant to be used for businesses to share slides among employees more easily,
but it also has expanded to become a host of a large number of slides that are uploaded merely to entertain. 
Although the website is primarily a slide hosting service, it also supports documents, PDFs, videos and webinars.
SlideShare also provides users the ability to rate, comment on, and share the uploaded content.
